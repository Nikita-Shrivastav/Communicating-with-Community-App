Communicating with Community is an assistive communication app designed in SwiftUI to help individuals, 
especially non-verbal users or early learners, express their needs, wants, and feelings using simple visual buttons and spoken phrases. 
The app offers a clean and intuitive interface that organizes communication options into three main categories — Needs, Wants, and Feelings. 
Each category contains visual tiles with relatable images such as water, food, or happy faces, and when tapped, 
the app uses Apple’s built-in text-to-speech engine to read the associated phrase aloud, making interaction natural and engaging.
Built with SwiftUI and powered by AVFoundation, Communicating with Community delivers a fast, accessible, and inclusive experience. 
It automatically selects the best available English voice for smooth and clear pronunciation. 
The navigation is simple: users start from a main screen, choose a category, and then tap an image card to hear the spoken message. 
This makes the app ideal for use in classrooms, therapy sessions, or at home, helping users communicate essential needs and emotions easily and confidently. 
It is especially helpful for children on the autism spectrum or elderly individuals who may have difficulty speaking, 
as it provides them with an easy, intuitive way to express themselves and connect with others.
The project is lightweight, requires minimal setup, and runs seamlessly across iPhone and iPad. 
Developers can customize it by adding new categories, phrases, or localized voices. 
With its elegant design, speech integration, and focus on accessibility, 
Communicating with Community serves as a meaningful tool to empower communication through technology and build stronger connections with those around us.
